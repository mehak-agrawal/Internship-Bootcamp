17. You are blindfolded (you can’t see). There are 100 coins lying on a table. 80 are tails-up and 20 are heads-up. You need to divide them into two groups of x and y each (x+y = 100). You can pick any coin and flip it (if its tails, it will become head and if its head, it will become tail), but you can’t see so you don’t know which coin you are flipping. In the end, the two groups should contain equal number of heads. What will be the value of x and y? [ HR , Flipkart ]

27. You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of each item.In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
