6. Converting Roman Numerals to Decimal lying between 1 to 3999 [ General, Tech, Facebook ]
7. Count all distinct pairs with difference equal to k [ Sorting, Code, Facebook ]
8. Decode a string recursively encoded as count followed by substring [ String, Code, Facebook ]
9. Find if string is K-Palindrome or not [ String, Code, Facebook ]
10. Find Minimum Depth of a Binary Tree [ BinaryTree, Code, Facebook ]
11. Find subarray with given sum [ Array, Code, Facebook ]
12. Given two unsorted arrays, find all pairs whose sum is x [ Array, Code, Facebook ]
13. Find the n’th term in Look-and-say (Or Count and Say) Sequence. The look-and-say sequence is the sequence of below integers: 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, …[ Map, Code, Facebook ]
14. Smallest subarray with sum greater than a given value [ Array, Code, Facebook ]
15. Program to add two binary strings  [ String , Tech, Facebook ]
16. Rearrange a string in sorted order followed by the integer sum[ String, Code, Facebook ]
17. Given a dictionary, a method to do a lookup in the dictionary and a M x N board where every cell has one character. Find all possible words that can be formed by a sequence of adjacent characters. Note that we can move to any of 8 adjacent characters, but a word should not have multiple instances of the same cell [ Trie, Code, Facebook ]
18. Count Possible Decodings of a given Digit Sequence [ DP, code, Facebook ]
19. Inplace rotate square matrix by 90 degrees [ Matrix, Code, Facebook ]
20. Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit. For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6}. The largest possible rectangle possible is 12 [ Stack, Code, Facebook ]
21. Largest sum subarray with at-least k numbers [ Array, Code, Facebook ]
22. Multiply Large Numbers represented as Strings  [ Strings, Code, Facebook ]
23. Median in a stream of integers (running integers) [ heaps, Code, Facebook ]
24. Find m-th smallest value in k sorted arrays [ Sorting, Code, Facebook ]
25. Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given array of integers, A. In other words, problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. [ DP, Code, Facebook ]
26. Given a grid of size m * n, let us assume you are starting at (1, 1) and your goal is to reach (m, n). At any instance, if you are on (x, y), you can either go to (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y).Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?An obstacle and empty space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. [ DP, code, facebook ]
27. A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping: 'A' -> 1 'B' -> 2 ... 'Z' ...To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:
* "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
* "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)
Note that the grouping (1 11 06) is invalid because "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' since "6" is different from "06".Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer. [ DP, Code, Facebook ]
28. We are given a linked list and positions m and n. We need to reverse the linked list from position m to n. [ LinkedList, Code, Facebook ]
29. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks. Say you have an array, A, for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit [ DP, Code, Facebook ]
30. Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. [ Map, Code, Facebook ]
31. Given a text and a wildcard pattern, implement wildcard pattern matching algorithm that finds if wildcard pattern is matched with text. The matching should cover the entire text (not partial text).
The wildcard pattern can include the characters ‘?’ and ‘*’ 
‘?’ – matches any single character 
‘*’ – Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence) [ DP, Code, Facebook ]
32. You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list. Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4) Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8 [ LinkedList, Code, Facebook ]
