24. A top secret message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:'A' -> 1'B' -> 2...'Z' -> 26. You are an FBI agent. You have to determine the total number of ways that message can be decoded, as the answer can be large return the answer modulo 109 + 7.Note: An empty digit sequence is considered to have one decoding. It may be assumed that the input contains valid digits from 0 to 9 and If there are leading 0’s, extra trailing 0’s and two or more consecutive 0’s then it is an invalid string.

25. Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not. A rectangle is denoted by providing the x and y coordinates of two points: the left top corner and the right bottom corner of the rectangle. Two rectangles sharing a side are considered overlapping.
