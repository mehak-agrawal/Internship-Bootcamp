Amazon Coding 


1. Write an efficient program for printing k largest elements in an array. Elements in an array can be in any order.[Array, Code,Amazon]
2. Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2.[Hashing,Code,Amazon]
3. Convert a given Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List. [BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
4. Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.[BinaryTree]
5. Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return a minimum element from the SpecialStack. All these operations of SpecialStack must be O(1). [Stack,Code,Amazon]
6. Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function). [LinkedList,Code,Amazon]
7. Given two numbers represented by two lists, write a function that returns the sum list. The sum list is a list representation of the addition of two input numbers.[LinkedList,Code,Amazon]
8. Given a square matrix, turn it by 90 degrees in anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.[Matrix,Code,Amazon]
9. Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in the array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider the next greater element as -1. [Array,Code,Amazon]
10. Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array. So 3 2 7 10 should return 13 (sum of 3 and 10) or 3 2 5 10 7 should return 15 (sum of 3, 5 and 7).Answer the question in most efficient way.[DP,Code,Amazon]
11. Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1’ into ‘str2’.  
1. Insert
2. Remove
3. Replace
4. All of the above operations are of equal cost. [DP,Code,Amazon]
12. Given a cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][], write a function that returns cost of minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0). Each cell of the matrix represents a cost to traverse through that cell. The total cost of a path to reach (m, n) is the sum of all the costs on that path (including both source and destination). You can only traverse down, right and diagonally lower cells from a given cell, i.e., from a given cell (i, j), cells (i+1, j), (i, j+1), and (i+1, j+1) can be traversed. You may assume that all costs are positive integers.[Graph,Code,Amazon]
13. Why Amazon?
14. Given a binary tree, print it vertically.[BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
15. In a party of N people, only one person is known to everyone. Such a person may be present in the party, if yes, (s)he doesn’t know anyone in the party. We can only ask questions like “does A know B? “. Find the stranger (celebrity) in the minimum number of questions.We can describe the problem input as an array of numbers/characters representing persons in the party. We also have a hypothetical function HaveAcquaintance(A, B) which returns true if A knows B, false otherwise. How can we solve the problem. [Graph,Code,Amazon]
16. Level order traversal of a tree.[BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
17. Given a singly linked list, swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end. Swapping of data is not allowed, only pointers should be changed. This requirement may be logical in many situations where the linked list data part is huge (For example student details line Name, RollNo, Address, ..etc). The pointers are always fixed (4 bytes for most of the compilers).[LinkedList,Code,Amazon]
18. Given a Binary Tree, convert it to a Binary Search Tree. The conversion must be done in such a way that keeps the original structure of Binary Tree. [BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
19. Given a binary tree, we need to find maximum value we can get by subtracting value of node B from value of node A, where A and B are two nodes of the binary tree and A is an ancestor of B. Expected time complexity is O(n).[BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
20. Find the distance between two keys in a binary tree, no parent pointers are given. The distance between two nodes is the minimum number of edges to be traversed to reach one node from another.[BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
21.  Given a boolean 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an island.  [BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
22. Do Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) .[Graph,Code,Amazon]
23. Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not. Your function should return true if the given graph contains at least one cycle, else return false.[Graph,Code,Amazon]
24. Write a function detectAndRemoveLoop() that checks whether a given Linked List contains loop and if loop is present then removes the loop and returns true. If the list doesn’t contain loop then it returns false.[LinkedList,Code,Amazon]
25. A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not.[BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
26. There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top.[General,Code,Amazon]
27.  Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum. [Array,Code,Amazon]
28. Given a string, a partitioning of the string is a palindrome partitioning if every substring of the partition is a palindrome. For example, “aba|b|bbabb|a|b|aba” is a palindrome partitioning of “ababbbabbababa”. Determine the fewest cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of a given string. For example, minimum of 3 cuts are needed for “ababbbabbababa”. The three cuts are “a|babbbab|b|ababa”. If a string is a palindrome, then minimum 0 cuts are needed. If a string of length n containing all different characters, then minimum n-1 cuts are needed. [String,Code,Amazon]
29. Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node. [BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
30. Given an array arr[], find the maximum j – i such that arr[j] > arr[i]. [Array,Code,Amazon]
31. Given an array of numbers, arrange them in a way that yields the largest value. For example, if the given numbers are {54, 546, 548, 60}, the arrangement 6054854654 gives the largest value.[Array,Code,Amazon]
32. Find the length of maximum numbers of consecutive numbers jumped up in an array. [Array,Code,Amazon]
33. Delete the elements in a linked list whose sum is equal to zero . [LinkedList,Code,Amazon]
34. Given an array of integers, find if it’s possible to remove exactly one integer from the array that divides the array into two subarrays with the same sum.[Array,Code,Amazon]
35. Find the diameter of a binary tree.[BinaryTree,Code,Amazon]
36. Given an array arr[] of n integers, find the maximum that maximizes the sum of the value of i*arr[i] where i varies from 0 to n-1. [Array,Code,Amazon]
37. Given a 2D array, print it in spiral form. [Matrix,Code,Amazon]
38. Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[]. Expected time complexity is O(Logn) .[Hashing,Code,Amazon]
39. Given two strings, string1 and string2, the task is to find the smallest substring in string1 containing all characters of string2 efficiently. [String,Code,Amazon]
40. Given an array and an integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.[Array,Code,Amazon]
41. Given an n x n matrix, where every row and column is sorted in non-decreasing order. Find the kth smallest element in the given 2D array.[Matrix,Code,Amazon]
42. There are n-pairs and therefore 2n people. everyone has one unique number ranging from 1 to 2n. All these 2n persons are arranged in random fashion in an Array of size 2n. We are also given who is partner of whom. Find the minimum number of swaps required to arrange these pairs such that all pairs become adjacent to each other.[General,Code,Amazon]
43. You are given a list of n-1 integers and these integers are in the range of 1 to n. There are no duplicates in the list. One of the integers is missing in the list. Write an efficient code to find the missing integer.[LinkedList,Code,Amazon]
44. Write an efficient C program to find smallest and second smallest element in an array.[Array,Code,Amazon]
45. Let 1 represent ‘A’, 2 represents ‘B’, etc. Given a digit sequence, count the number of possible decodings of the given digit sequence.[DP,Code,Amazon]
